# acast_dl.py

The purpose of this script is to easily download podcast files from Acast for offline listening.

## Limitations

- this script is currently a wip and has been tested with only a very little set of podcast feeds
- this script only support `.mp3` files

## AI usage

Please note that part of this script has been written using [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) (GPT-4o + GPT-5) as a teammate.

This project is an excuse to see how good AI is at helping to write small tools (I always have lots of ideas but don't have time to implement them).

# Dependencies

`acast_dl` relies on three dependencies :
- [`feedparser`](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser) : for retrieving and parsing the RSS XML feed
- [`mutagen`](https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen) : for updating ID3 MP3 tags
- [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) : to show a progress bar when downloading the files

You can either install them with your favorite package manager or install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and launch `acast_dl.py` right away.

It makes use of [PEP-723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) that allows to add metadata :

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.8"
# dependencies = [
#     "feedparser",
#     "mutagen",
#     "tqdm"
# ]
# ///
```

When launched the first time you'll see `uv` downloading and installing the dependencies :

```
TODO
```

I got the inspiration to use `uv` thanks to this blog post : [Fun with uv and PEP 723](https://www.cottongeeks.com/articles/2025-06-24-fun-with-uv-and-pep-723) (related [hn post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44369388)).

  - [ ] `--ignore-rss-cache` : ignore ETag
  - [ ] `--rss-cache-file` : to override `.rss_cache.json` (not sure about the usefulness of this one)
